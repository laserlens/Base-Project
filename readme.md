# Base Project Assignment

In this assignment I am demonstrating the fallowing.
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new folder on your machine. This folder is your project.
3. Initialize a Git repository in that project (folder).
Create an index.html and populate it with base functionality for an HTML page.
4. Create an app.js file that will serve as your functionality for your site. Make sure to include comments with the author and date of creation.
5. Create a stylesheet.css; no population of content needed at this time.
6. Link the Javascript and CSS file to your HTML file.
7. Create a README.md Markdown file and explain each of the files within the project. See GitHub's Mastering Markdown for syntax help.
8. Push your completed project to the new GitHub repo.
